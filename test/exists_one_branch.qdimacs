c EXISTS needs only one branch
c
c Formula: EXISTS x (x OR NOT x)
c
c This formula is trivially SATISFIABLE because:
c   - (x OR NOT x) is a tautology - always true regardless of x
c   - EXISTS only needs to find ONE value, and either works!
c
c This shows that EXISTS succeeds if ANY branch works.

c Expected result: SATISFIABLE
