c FORALL player wins (UNSAT)
c
c Formula: FORALL x EXISTS y (x OR y) AND (NOT x OR y) AND (x OR NOT y) AND (NOT x OR NOT y)
c
c This formula is UNSATISFIABLE because:
c   No matter what y the EXISTS player picks, one of the clauses will be false.
c
c   Analysis for x=true:
c     y=true:  (T OR T) AND (F OR T) AND (T OR F) AND (F OR F) = T AND T AND T AND F = F
c     y=false: (T OR F) AND (F OR F) AND (T OR T) AND (F OR T) = T AND F AND T AND T = F
c
c   Analysis for x=false:
c     y=true:  (F OR T) AND (T OR T) AND (F OR F) AND (T OR F) = T AND T AND F AND T = F
c     y=false: (F OR F) AND (T OR F) AND (F OR T) AND (T OR T) = F AND T AND T AND T = F
c
c The FORALL player can always falsify by picking x=true (or x=false).

c Expected result: UNSATISFIABLE
