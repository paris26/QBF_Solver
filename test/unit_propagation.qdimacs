c Unit Propagation Example
c
c Formula: EXISTS x1, x2 (x1) AND (NOT x1 OR x2)
c
c This formula demonstrates unit propagation:
c   1. Clause (x1) is a unit clause - x1 MUST be true
c   2. With x1=true, clause (NOT x1 OR x2) becomes (FALSE OR x2) = (x2)
c   3. Now (x2) is a unit clause - x2 MUST be true
c   4. All clauses satisfied!
c
c Preprocessing should solve this entirely without search.

c Expected result: SATISFIABLE
