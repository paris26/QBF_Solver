c Alternating Quantifiers Example
c
c Formula: FORALL x EXISTS y FORALL z (x OR y OR z) AND (NOT x OR NOT y OR NOT z)
c
c This formula has alternating quantifier blocks: FORALL-EXISTS-FORALL
c
c Analysis:
c   For the EXISTS player to win, for each x value, they must find a y
c   such that for ALL z values, the formula is satisfied.
c
c   Let's check x=true:
c     Try y=false:
c       z=true:  (T OR F OR T) AND (F OR T OR F) = T AND T = T
c       z=false: (T OR F OR F) AND (F OR T OR T) = T AND T = T
c     y=false works for all z! EXISTS found a winning response.
c
c   Let's check x=false:
c     Try y=true:
c       z=true:  (F OR T OR T) AND (T OR F OR F) = T AND T = T
c       z=false: (F OR T OR F) AND (T OR F OR T) = T AND T = T
c     y=true works for all z! EXISTS found a winning response.
