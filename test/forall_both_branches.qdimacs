c FORALL requires both branches to succeed
c
c Formula: FORALL x EXISTS y (x OR y) AND (NOT x OR NOT y)
c
c This formula is SATISFIABLE because:
c   - When x=true:  EXISTS can pick y=false -> (T OR F) AND (F OR T) = T AND T = T
c   - When x=false: EXISTS can pick y=true  -> (F OR T) AND (T OR F) = T AND T = T
c
c The EXISTS player has a winning strategy for BOTH values of x.
c This is the classic example showing why FORALL needs both branches.
c
c Game interpretation:
c   FORALL player: "I'll try to break your formula!"
c   EXISTS player: "Whatever x you pick, I can respond with the right y"
c
c Expected result: SATISFIABLE
